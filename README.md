# C Workshop

This workshop is designed to help you learn C. The aim is to make it as advanced or simple as you want.

### Rules

These are to try and get you used to writing C for embedded devices. 

- No using `int`. Use fixed-width types, e.g. `uint16_t`.
- No using `malloc`

## Tasks

1. In the `src` folder, make a file called `workshop.c`. Make this file print `Hello World!` to the command line.
2. Edit the `main` method to read a string from the command line and then print it. This can either be passed as a command line argument or taken as input within the function.
3. Create a header file with a `struct` for a person. This should have fields for name and age.
4. In your `main` method, use user input to populate an instance of your `struct`.
5. Make a function that takes a pointer to a `struct` and prints each field to the command line
6.
